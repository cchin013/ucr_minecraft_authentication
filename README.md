# ucr_minecraft_authentication
website made to ensure that only UCR students get on the UCR minecraft server - made for HLG

made with:

- Laravel (and by extension - Composer)
- VueJS (and by extension - HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
- Node (literally just because I need npm to install vue and it comes with node)

things i've learned:
don't develop on windows because things don't work out of the box 99% of the time wooooooo
